## Define Monolithic architecture

##### A monolithic application is an application that is made up of one large codebase that includes all the application components, such as the frontend code, backend code, and configuration files.

## Explain microservices in your own understanding

#### Microservices splits up each part of the application into independent codebases. For example, deploying the components or modules of the application differently while communicating with the use of Application Programming Interface (API)

## Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?

#### I prefer the microservices as this gives room for easy scalability, codebase management and debugging

## Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?

#### Nodejs is not a multithreaded language. It is a single-threaded language.

## What does REPL stand for?

#### REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop
